I have created a website for a construction company. 

Tools/Frameworks used for this project include:


SASS = this turned your regular CSS into batman

COMPASS = this with SASS turns your css into SUPERMAN! 

FOUNDATION = a terrific tool to build a website. It includes a lot of cool java script plugins and best, it makes your site responsive. Builds on the theory, Mobile First!
